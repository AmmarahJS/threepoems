I shot an arrow into the air, 
It fell to earth, I knew not where; 
For, so swiftly it flew, the sight 
Could not follow it in its flight. 
I breathed a song into the air, 
It fell to earth, I knew not where; 
For who has sight so keen and strong
That it can follow the flight of song? 
Long, long afterward, in an oak 
I found the arrow, still unbroke; 
And the song, from beginning to end,
I found again in the heart of a friend . 

Nae shoon to hide her tiny taes, 
Nae stockin' on her feet; 
Her supple ankles white as snaw, 
Or early blossoms sweet. 
Her simple dress o' sprinkled pink, 
Her double, dimplit chin, 
Her puckered lips, and baumy mou',
With na ane tooth within. 
Her een sae like her mither's een, 
Twa gentle, liquid things; 
Her face is like an angel's face: 
We're glad she has nae wings. 

Let Dogs Delight to 
Bark and Bite 
Let dogs delight to bark and bite, 
For God hath made them so; 
Let bears and lions growl and fight,
For 'tis their nature too. 
But, children, you should never let 
Such angry passions rise; 
Your little hands were never made 
To tear each other's eyes. 

Little drops of water, 
 Little grains of sand, 
Make the mighty ocean 
 And the pleasant land. 
Thus the little minutes, 
 Humble though they be, 
Make the mighty ages 
 Of eternity. 

He Prayeth Best 
Farewell, farewell! but this I tell 
To thee, thou Wedding-Guest! 
He prayeth well who loveth well 
Both man and bird and beast. 
He prayeth best who loveth best 
All things, both great and small:
For the dear God who loveth us, 
He made and loveth all.
